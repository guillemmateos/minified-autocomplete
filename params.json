{"name":"Minified-autocomplete","tagline":"Naked autocomplete script using minified.js library","body":"# Minified-autocomplete\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nThis is a naked-as-possible implementation of a so called live-search (or autocomplete) feature for input fields using [minified.js](http://www.minified.js) as library. Given the fact that minified.js is a really small library and the features used are mostly selectors it should be fairly easy to convert this script to a version without library dependencies\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nJust use the class 'autocomplete' on your input field. Of course you should include the CSS and JS files for autocomplete-minified and minified.js itself for this script to work. Then essentially change the 'suggestions' array to suit your needs and you are ready to go. This script does not provide the parameter as an option as this was not the intention when developing it, but it should be straightforward to adapt it to your requirements\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
